//First attempt,
//generate data and insert into db inline. 4gb of memory used, and takes over one hour.

//Second attempt and third attempt,
//batching generation with insertion using setTimeout to add successive insertions to the event loop.
//Further refinement of batching and sub batching reduced to 90 seconds,

//Fourth attempt,
//moving data to csv for mongo import
